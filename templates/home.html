  <h1>CS50 Switch: Wake Up Smarter</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>CS50 Switch</strong> — a smart, automatic light switch system designed to help you wake up naturally and comfortably using timed lighting. 
    Rather than waking up to the harsh jolt of a loud alarm, CS50 Switch uses a physical servo motor to turn your room light on at a scheduled time, 
    giving your body and mind time to adjust to the light gradually before you're even out of bed.
  </p>

  <h2>The Purpose Behind CS50 Switch</h2>
  <p>
    Getting out of bed in the morning can be tough. Especially in dark rooms or colder months, the sudden switch from deep sleep to total wakefulness is not ideal.
    That’s why CS50 Switch was developed — to provide a seamless transition from sleep to wakefulness by automatically activating your lights <strong>10 minutes before your alarm</strong>.
    This gentle light exposure prepares your brain to wake up more naturally, reducing grogginess and improving mood and mental performance for the rest of the day.
  </p>

  <h2>Built for Simplicity, Designed for Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    CS50 Switch is a fully self-contained system that connects to your Wi-Fi and operates through a minimal, secure web interface. You can set alarms, toggle the light manually, and check your setup status from any device on your home network. Whether you're a student working on your final project or a tech enthusiast experimenting with home automation, CS50 Switch offers a solid foundation for smart living.
